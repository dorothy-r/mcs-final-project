                        <h4>How is music beneficial during pregnancy and birth?</h4>
                    </div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Babies can hear sounds from outside the womb by the end of the second trimester. Singing, playing, and listening to music can help parents to bond with their child even before birth. Parents can develop a musical relationship with their child that extends beyond birth, helping to welcome their baby with familiar sounds and voices.</p>
                        <p>During birth, music can increase feelings of safety and relaxation, and decrease anxiety and perceived pain. Music can help the birthing person to regulate their breathing, and can support movement that allows for optimal fetal position. Having music playing during birth also benefits the birth partner and other members of the birthing team, as they also experience its calming, focusing effects.</p>

                        <h4>How can music therapy help during the postpartum period?</h4>
                    </div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Music can support both the parent and the newborn during this time of life. It supports parent-baby communication, attachment and bonding, and social development. For parents, music therapy can also be a safe space to process feelings around the transition to parenthood and around the birth experience. Postpartum music therapy can be done with individual parent-baby dyads, or in a group setting with other parents and babies, allowing for peer support and socializing.</p>

                        <h4>What does a typical session look like?</h4>
                    </div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>This can vary quite a bit, depending on a client's unique strengths, needs, and goals, as well as where they are in the pregnancy or parenting experience. A session might involve listening to music and planning birth playlists, writing and singing a song for your baby, improvising using musical instruments, or just talking.</p>
